Like the title says, an unordered list of tech blogs I follow. I'll try to keep it updated as time passes (might lead to some of them getting removed).

[Paul Grahams website](http://paulgraham.com/index.html) - As the founder of YCombinator he has some deep insights on tech and anything else really  

[Dan Luus website](https://danluu.com/) - A blog about hardware engineering and other topics, the tone can get quite sarcastic which I like  

[Increment](https://increment.com/) - Tech blog published by Stripe  

[MB SX](https://tinyletter.com/mbutterick/archive) - The beautiful blog of Mathew Butterick, a great Computer Scientist and Typographer  

[O'Rilley Radar Trends](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/topics/radar-trends/) - A broad list of current technological trends  

[Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) - Hands down the best blog about the european tech market, also has some great content about leadership and careers in tech  

[Rands in Response](https://randsinrepose.com/) - Mainly about leadership and management  

[Vitalik Buterins blog](https://vitalik.ca/) - Some great technical content about blockchain technologies  

[Fefe](http://blog.fefe.de/) - This one is german but definitely worth a read if you understand the language
