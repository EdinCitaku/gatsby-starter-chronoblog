Luxembourg (city) is  rather small with very international residents (over 50% of people come from abroad). Most people there speak French, but English works well, as well as the native language Luxembourgish which has similarities to German. I enjoyed the city but personally four months were enough for me. I felt like after that time I have seen most of Luxembourg and there wasn\\u2019t much left to discover. Luckily Luxembourg is placed right in the center of Europe, so traveling was definitely an option especially for quick weekend trips to say Amsterdam or Brussels.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The office itself is placed in the business district Kirchberg.

This created an atmosphere of open mindedness and led to many interesting conversations. I made many friends in the office and also traveled with them during my internship.

Those projects are not just toy projects but are supposed to go into production. So even as an intern you already get real responsibility. Quality and impact of those projects can vary quite a lot tho. Some interns I talked to (including the previous intern at my team) got projects that were very important to the team and got good guidance. I personally got a bit unlucky, the person who was supposed to create and supervise my project got switched right before my internship because of that my project had low impact overall and was barely thought out. So the beginning of my internship was mostly gathering requirements and just coming up with some concrete goals of my project. As my project modified a system that was not in production yet, I could never see the impact of my work. In general I would say my particular internship project was not that great but I got quite unlucky as most of the interns I talked to had much different experiences.

I made many great friendships that will remain even after I have left. Personally I would not return to Luxembourg if the Chance was given, as the city was just too small for my personal taste. It is quite easy to use the return offer from the Luxembourg office and just return to another office that is more suitable for you tho, I talked to hiring managers in both Berlin and London and the process of moving teams seemed quite easy and comfortable.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"id":"a35da60e-2d36-5004-aa0e-26afb9472d27"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1961101537","2542493696"]}
