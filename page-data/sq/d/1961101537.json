They just state their job description as if it was some to-do list. What they actually should be doing is to focus on their impact first. How did they make the company money? A job posting is about business after all, you work for a company to make them more money than they pay for you. Your resume should reflect that. How did you make your company money, and what impact did you have in this process?\\nA common mistake I see in resume (admittedly not in this one) is that people talk about all their technical skills and how they implemented XY in framework Z. What they dont realize is that the tech is not that important, the actual impact the tech had is much much more important.\\nWhy did you implement XY? Did it make some process more efficient, did it solve some business critical problem? Focus on that! Of course having some metrics would make it even more impressive, though it is not always realistic to have those at hand (How much money did ur process save?, how many people use your software regularly?, etc.)\\nAnd only after you have explained all the impact you had in your company and how you improved your company from the inside, only then you should talk about what specific technologies you used to achieve that.\", mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"This is of course talking about actual job experience.
